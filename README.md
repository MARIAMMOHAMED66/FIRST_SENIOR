SWE491 PROJECT
This particular project upgrades the dashboard of the Learning Management System (LMS) to an instrumental feedback platform through which student members and academic instructors can present any suggestions through "Make a Suggestion" page. After undergoing approval from admin, students can vote or comment against the suggestions put. The same serves the purpose for students to report any issues or share concerns about campus life or university courses. The major functions of this PMT would include exam timetables, course enrollments, messaging, and a complaints and suggestions dashboard with the aim of creating a more interactive supportive academic environment. The system is built up using PHP, HTML and Bootstrap, providing great scalability and user-friendliness, thus ensuring efficiency in administration and student satisfaction at better levels.
